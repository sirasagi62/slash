# Additional Files Recommendation

Based on the current repository structure, you may consider adding the following files/directories to support future development:

- **`cmd/` directory** (planned subcommands):
  - `cmd/version/main.go` â€“ Implements the `slash version` subcommand.

- **`internal/util/` package**:
  - Helper functions for file I/O, error handling, and common utilities.

- **`VERSION` file** (or embed version information):
  - Contains the current version string for the `slash version` command.

- **`Makefile`** or **`go.releaser.yml`**:
  - For building, testing, and releasing the binary.

- **`README.md`**:
  - Documentation for usage, installation, and contribution guidelines.

- **`LICENSE`**:
  - License file for the project.

These files are not required for the current functionality but will help you implement the planned features described in `plan.md`. Feel free to add them as needed.
